These attacks often occur through email, social media, or malicious websites. Phishing emails typically appear to come from reputable sources like banks, online services, or government agencies, urging you to click on a link or download an attachment that leads to a fake website or malware installation.

  1. The source, Always check the senderâ€™s email address carefully. Even if it appears legitimate, look for for subtle issues or misspellings.
